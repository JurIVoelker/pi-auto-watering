# pi-auto-watering
I'm developing an automatic watering system for my bachelor's project in Media Computer Science. A Raspberry Pi measures plant weight with a load cell to determine watering time. A camera captures images for growth monitoring and time-lapse videos. Data is sent to a cloud server and visualized in a web app, which also allows manual control.
