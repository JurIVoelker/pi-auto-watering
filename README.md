# pi-auto-watering
For my bachelor's project in Media Computer Science, I am developing an automatic watering system using a Raspberry Pi. The system determines the optimal watering time based on the weight of the plant, which is measured with a load cell. In addition, a camera captures images to monitor growth and create time-lapse videos.

The collected data is sent to a cloud-hosted server where it is visualised in a web application. The web application also allows users to monitor the system and manually control watering as needed.
